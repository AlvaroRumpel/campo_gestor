# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md

**Core value:** O histórico técnico do animal individual — reprodutivo e sanitário — acessível em campo
**Current phase:** 04
**Current plan:** 3 of 3 (all plans code-complete; Task 5 DB push BLOCKED pending manual credentials)
**Progress:** [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions Made During Roadmap

- **Phase 0 is infrastructure-only** (no requirement IDs). It is the prerequisite for every other phase per research/SUMMARY.md.
- **ANIM-03 (ficha consolidada) deferred to Phase 8** because it cross-cuts reproductive (Phase 5) and sanitary (Phase 6). Earlier phases deliver partial views; Phase 8 finalizes.
- **Risk-retirement prototypes (numbering RPC, snapshot JSONB, ATF partial unique index) live in Phase 2** even though only PROP-01/PROP-02 are formally consumed there. This validates technical risk before larger phases depend on them.
- **Phases 5, 6, 7 are parallelizable** once their prerequisites are met (3 for 5/6, 2 for 7).
- **Granularity calibrated to 9 phases** per `fine` setting (target 8–12). Each phase delivers a coherent, verifiable capability.

### Open Decisions Needed Before Phase 1 Coding

From research/SUMMARY.md — must be resolved with stakeholder (~30 min):

1. Animal numbering scope — global per propriedade vs (propriedade + categoria)
2. Number reusable after soft delete — recommended NO
3. LoteATF closure mode — manual with alert when all DGs filled
4. Sanitary application default — all lot animals pre-selected, individual deselection allowed
5. Auth method — email/password only for MVP
6. Supabase plan — free vs pro (verify pg_cron / Realtime availability)

### Active TODOs

- Resolve 6 open decisions before starting Phase 1 implementation
- Confirm with veterinarian domain expert before Phase 5/6 (DG math, UA validation)

### Phase 0 Completion Notes

- **`[analytics] enabled = false`** in `supabase/config.toml` — Docker socket unreachable from `supabase_vector` container on Windows WSL2. Safe for local dev.
- **`integration_test` no web support** — SC-1 verified manually via `flutter run -d edge`. Use `-d windows` for automated integration tests.
- **Riverpod 3.x** (upgraded from planned 2.x) — all future phases must use Riverpod 3.x / codegen 4.x APIs.
- **custom_lint / riverpod_lint deferred** — incompatible with flutter_riverpod 3.x + freezed_annotation 3.x stack.

### Blockers

- **Phase 4 UAT blocked on manual Supabase schema push.** `supabase/migrations/20260519_04_movements.sql` (move_lot_to_paddock RPC, MOV-02) is authored and verified on disk but NOT applied to the dev Supabase project — this execution session's Supabase CLI is unlinked/unauthenticated (`supabase db push --dry-run` → "Cannot find project ref. Have you run supabase link?"). A human must run `supabase link --project-ref <dev-project-ref>` (if needed) then `supabase db push` from a machine with dev credentials before `/gsd-verify-work` can exercise MOV-02's live RPC path.

## Session Continuity

**Stopped at:** Completed 04-03-PLAN.md (Task 5 BLOCKED — manual DB push pending)
**Resume file:** None

**Last session:** 2026-07-15T22:45:00.000Z
**Next action:** Manual: run `supabase link` (if needed) + `supabase db push` from a machine with dev Supabase credentials, then run `/gsd-verify-work` for Phase 4 (Movements) — all 3 plans (04-01, 04-02, 04-03) are code-complete.
**Files of interest:**

- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — vision and constraints
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — 26 v1 requirements with traceability
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — 9-phase plan with success criteria
- `.planning/research/SUMMARY.md` — stack, build order, pitfalls

## Notes

- Project is Flutter web-first + Supabase. All multi-tenant isolation via RLS. Atomic operations via PL/pgSQL RPCs.
- Two independent lot types: Lote (operacional) and LoteATF (reprodutivo). Different tables, never enum-merged.
- Snapshot sanitário is immutable post-INSERT — enforced by trigger + RLS.
- Animal número único per propriedade (exact key tuple to be confirmed by Open Decision #1).

## Decisions

- [Phase 04]: 04-01: memberPropertiesProvider override (not currentPropertyProvider directly) drives Wave 0 canEdit gate tests, reusing CurrentPropertyNotifier's single-membership auto-select logic
- [Phase 04]: 04-02: loteListByPropertyProvider implemented as a plain (non-family) FutureProvider<List<Lot>> resolving currentPropertyProvider internally, deviating from the plan's family+DTO spec to match the already-committed Wave 0 widget test override contract
- [Phase 04]: 04-03: Task 5 (supabase db push for move_lot_to_paddock RPC) BLOCKED — this session's Supabase CLI is unlinked/unauthenticated, no TTY for a DB password. Migration file authored and verified on disk; manual push required before MOV-02 UAT.
- [Phase 04]: 04-03: _FakeLoteRepository (implements LoteRepository, in test/widget/lote_form_dialog_test.dart) needed stub overrides for fetchLotsWithCountByProperty (04-02) and moveLot (04-03) — flagging as a recurring maintenance tax on LoteRepository's public surface for future plans.
